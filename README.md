# Tensorflow VGG16 (and VGG19)

Fork of machrisaa's VGG repository, of which I currently only use vgg16.py as a pretrained model, which I have cleaned up a bit for that purpose.


To use VGG16, [the weights](https://mega.nz/#!YU1FWJrA!O1ywiCS2IiOlUCtCpI6HTJOMrneN-Qdv3ywQP5poecM) have to be downloaded.
